# Angular Routing

A university project to explain the concepts of angular routing to a beginner

This project is a simple Angular 6 web tutorial to introduce beginners to the concept of routing within the framework. It explores basic concepts from simple routes and redirects, to some more advanced topics like data routes and data guards.

This is not intended to be an exhaustive tutorial, but more of an introduction to the framework and how to develop within it.

This app is hosted at:
https://sam-innes.github.io/angular_routing/

To build and serve you will need to run the following commands from a CLI within the soruce directory:
'npm install'
'ng serve --open'

This will open up a browser window with the app running locally.
